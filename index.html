        <h1 id="intro">Hi, I'm Gail.</h1>
        <h3>I'm a software engineer with a passion for creative problem-solving and enhancing the user experience. After working as an Account Manager for an electronic medical record company, I discovered that it was the technical side of what I was doing that really fascinated me.</h3><br>

          <p>In 2021, I completed a 12-week software engineering immersive boot camp at General Assembly, where I honed my front-end development skills and gained experience in back-end development. My friends often comment on my creativity and ask why I didn't pursue a career in design, but I love being able to bring ideas to life through coding. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SASS, React, and a variety of tech stacks, and I enjoy collaborating with others on GitHub.<br><br>
          
          When I'm not coding, you can find me rock climbing, hiking, researching brain/bio-hacking, and baking bread. I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself and stay inspired!<br><br>
        
          My professional goals are centered around my passion for enhancing people's lives and making the world a better place. I'm looking for a workplace that aligns with these values and provides opportunities for mentorship, learning, and growth. I believe in fostering an innovative and communicative environment where employees are recognized as people and can thrive. As a go-to person for answers, I aim to contribute to strategic planning and to work smarter, not harder, in order to make people's lives easier. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and companies who share my vision.</p>
